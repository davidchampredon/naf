=== MAJOR ITEMS ===

- Make output and plots for interventions comparison

- fit age distribution given household size on overall age distribution

- split data Toronto vs rest of Ontario

- Hospitalized are both in _indiv_Is and _indiv_H: change that to only _indiv_H???

- Treatment & vax affects hospitalization outcome

- Performance tests


=== MINOR ITEMS ===

- _id_Is and _indiv_Is redundant

- immunities are deterministically allocated: change to stochastic?

- put age determinant for schedule as model parameters (currently hard coded)
