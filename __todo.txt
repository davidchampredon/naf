- STOPPED HERE: change function 'merge.pop.mc' using new output 'res.list[[1]]$world_final'


=== MAJOR ITEMS ===

- Finalize data used for final stage, fit, robustness, etc...

- Make simulations simple to run, such that launching multi-scenario will be simple

- Make table output for interventions comparison

- Hospitalized are both in _indiv_Is and _indiv_H: change that to only _indiv_H???
- Treatment & vax affects hospitalization outcome
- Performance tests


=== MINOR ITEMS ===

- _id_Is and _indiv_Is redundant	

- put age determinant for schedule as model parameters (currently hard coded)
