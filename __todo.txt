=== MAJOR ITEMS ===

- double check vaccinationtarget populations

- Finalize data used for final stage, fit, robustness, etc...

- Hospitalized are both in _indiv_Is and _indiv_H: change that to only _indiv_H???
- Treatment & vax affects hospitalization outcome
- Performance tests


=== MINOR ITEMS ===

- _id_Is and _indiv_Is redundant	

- put age determinant for schedule as model parameters (currently hard coded)
