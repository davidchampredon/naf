_____________________
===  MAJOR ITEMS  ===
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fits to automatize : R0, asymptomatic fraction

- visualize inputs

- TEST Change shape calc_proba_hosp from 'step' to logistic

- Reduce # of 'Arbitrary' in "_all_param_value_source.xlsx"

- Implement sensitivity analysis 

- Hospitalized are both in _indiv_Is and _indiv_H: change that to only _indiv_H???
- Treatment & vax affects hospitalization outcome


_____________________
===  MINOR ITEMS  ===
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Make more diagrams (?)

- change "test.cpp/h" to "run.cpp/h"

- _id_Is and _indiv_Is redundant	

- put age determinant for schedule as model parameters (currently hard coded)

 ---  Notes  ---
 
 * FIT R0:
 
 - For R0 = 1.8:
	contact rate: mean = 4, CV = 0.5
 	scale factor = 900
	init # infectious: 5
	ratio_1_10 = 15, ratio_10_16 = 3, ratio_over65 = 1
	ratio_sp_xxx = 1 for all
	proba move = 0.98, proba chg sp_other = 0.0
	
	WARNING: same parameter as above, but with scale factor = 300 gives R0~4

 
 
 INPUTS:
 	- Vax target population (2)
	- Vax rate (2)
	- Vax efficacy (2)
	- Deployement lag (5)
	- R0 (2)
	- Pre-existing immuntity (2)
	
 OUTPUTS:
 	- Cumul symptomatic incidence
	- Total # treated
	- Total # hospitalizations
	- Total # deaths
	
 RESULTS:
 	- Relative change cumulative symptomatic incidence
	- Relative change treated
	- Relative change hospitalizations
	- Relative change deaths
	
 PLOTS: 
 	- x: relative change *** ; y: vax rate
