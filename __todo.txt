===  MAJOR ITEMS  ===
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- find ILI visits and virological/serological test by age group in Ontario for seasonal flu in order to double check which are the most exposed groups

- Add Outputs: 	CFR

- Extract case-fatality-ratio from simulation and compare with real ones (by age). See :Hardelid P, Pebody R, Andrews N (2012) Mortality caused by influenza and respiratory syncytial virus by age group in England and Wales 1999–2010. Influenza Other Respi Viruses 7: 35–45. 

- Finalize data used for final stage, fit, robustness, etc...

- Hospitalized are both in _indiv_Is and _indiv_H: change that to only _indiv_H???
- Treatment & vax affects hospitalization outcome



_____________________
===  MINOR ITEMS  ===
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- _id_Is and _indiv_Is redundant	

- put age determinant for schedule as model parameters (currently hard coded)
