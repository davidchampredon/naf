_____________________
===  MAJOR ITEMS  ===
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fits to automatize : R0, asymptomatic fraction

- visualize inputs

- TEST Change shape calc_proba_hosp from 'step' to logistic

- Reduce # of 'Arbitrary' in "_all_param_value_source.xlsx"

- Implement sensitivity analysis 

- Hospitalized are both in _indiv_Is and _indiv_H: change that to only _indiv_H???
- Treatment & vax affects hospitalization outcome


_____________________
===  MINOR ITEMS  ===
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Make more diagrams (?)

- change "test.cpp/h" to "run.cpp/h"

- _id_Is and _indiv_Is redundant	

- put age determinant for schedule as model parameters (currently hard coded)
