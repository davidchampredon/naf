===  MAJOR ITEMS  ===
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Reduce # of 'Arbitrary' in "_all_param_value_source.xlsx"

- Change shape clac_proba_hosp from 'step' to logistic

- Display and Calibrate asymptomatic proportion

- Implement sensitivity analysis 

- Finalize data used for final stage, fit, robustness, etc...

- Hospitalized are both in _indiv_Is and _indiv_H: change that to only _indiv_H???
- Treatment & vax affects hospitalization outcome


_____________________
===  MINOR ITEMS  ===
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- change "test.cpp/h" to "run.cpp/h"

- _id_Is and _indiv_Is redundant	

- put age determinant for schedule as model parameters (currently hard coded)
